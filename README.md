# About
A mini game to guess a word. This game is made using visual basic 6. This game I created when still in college at 2010 for exercise my programming skill. There are 2 programs :
- **Word Hide Data Editor**: Edited to add game vocabulary
- **Word Hide**: The game

# How To Play
Fill in the text box with a letter, then press enter to guess a sentence. Each correct letter is added by 10 and false is subtracted by 5. Each sentence has the chance of being wrong 10 times.
